# Pirate Intelligent Agent Project

## Overview

This project showcases the implementation of a pirate intelligent agent using reinforcement learning and neural networks. The goal was to train the agent to navigate a maze and find treasure efficiently.

## Project Details

### Given Code
- **TreasureMaze.py**: This file contained the environment setup, including the maze structure and rules for movement and rewards.
- **GameExperience.py**: This file provided the experience replay mechanism, which stores and retrieves experiences for training the neural network.
- **Utilities**: Various utility functions for formatting time and handling other miscellaneous tasks.

### Created Code
- **qtrain Function**: Implemented the training loop for the intelligent agent, including exploration vs. exploitation, action selection, environment interaction, and neural network training.
- **Neural Network Model**: Designed and trained a neural network model to predict Q-values and guide the agent's actions.
- **Reflection and Evaluation**: Added code to evaluate the agent's performance and adjust training parameters.

## Reflection

### What I Did on This Project
